This repository contains the code and data for Lab 1 of the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project. The goal of this lab is to perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on a given dataset, following the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) model.
CRISP-DM Steps

    Business Understanding:
        Understand the project objectives and requirements.
        Define the questions we want to answer through data analysis.
        Determine how the results will be used to drive business decisions.

    Data Understanding:
        Gather and explore the available data.
        Identify the relevant variables and their relationships.
        Assess data quality and completeness.
        Document initial findings and assumptions.

    Data Preparation:
        Clean and preprocess the data as necessary.
        Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
        Transform variables and create derived features if needed.
        Document the steps taken for data preparation.

    Data Analysis:
        Perform exploratory analysis on the prepared dataset.
        Identify patterns, trends, and relationships.
        Generate descriptive statistics, visualizations, and insights.
        Answer the defined questions using data-driven evidence.

    Results Evaluation:
        Evaluate the results of the data analysis.
        Interpret the findings in the context of the business objectives.
        Assess the quality and reliability of the results.
        Determine any further actions or additional analyses needed.
